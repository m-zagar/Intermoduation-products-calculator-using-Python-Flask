# Intermoduation products calculator using Python Flask

Web application created for the "Selective Project I" course. Chosen subject was "Computing skills". (Undergraduate University Study of Computing)

The goal of the project was to create a web application that would, given a set of user input parameters/variables, calculate and plot intermodulation products. 

The idea was to explain to the user what intermodulation products are and how to calculate them, to give the user a simple UI for inputing variables and to simply visualize said products from the given variables. 

The code was written in vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript as well as a few different Python libraries. The simple backend was written in Python Flask. Due to backend restrictions, this version of the application was scraped for a version using PHP as the backend language.
